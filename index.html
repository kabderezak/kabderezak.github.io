                <h1><br>Brief</h1>    
                <p>
                        Quizzito family was designed for Eurl Kitabquiz an Algerian enterprise 
                        interested in kids’ education. They asked me to redesign both their 
                        mobile app user experience and user interface. We did it to add 
                        some functionalities and solve some usability problems. <br>
                        
                        Kid’s, in general, don’t enjoy reading and parents don’t find enough 
                        time to follow with them although they know the importance of such 
                        a thing. <br>
                        
                        This app encourages kids to read more books by enabling them to 
                        win points for each played quiz (quizzes are about books). After 
                        collecting enough points, the kid can use them to buy gifts. The 
                        parents suggest both books and gifts. <br>
                        
                        My challenge was to merge the two existing applications and design 
                        a new experience for two different users while keeping the same 
                        identity.
                        
                </p>
                <h1><br>Research</h1> 
                <h2><br>Stakeholders interviews</h2> 
                <p>
                        At our first interview I prepared a few precise questions to know more about the strategy and business objectives. I found that we can resume the concept in three words: Read, Play, Win.
                        <br>
                        Quizzito Family push the kids to read the maximum number of books. The parents choose those books from the app library where they can search and filter using many criteria. Furthermore, it suggests to them suitable books using artificial intelligence. Second, it offers what kids like the most, playing and having fun. It aims to give them an enjoyable experience through tailored quizzes screens. Finally, if they understood the books, they will win points which enables them to buy the suggested gifts.
                        <br>
                        Additionally, to the parents, Quizzito Family has a reading competitions section in order to grow their DAU.
                        
                </p>
                <h2><br>Existing product audit</h2>
                <p>
                        First, I started with the parents' side. My first impression was that it looks very standard with poor material UI. Once started using it I noticed a bad information architecture and design. But the critical issue was the misleading storyboarding (It was not clear for the parent how and when to add gifts). When I discussed this with stakeholders, they admitted that they had a significant user drop because of this issue.
                        <br>
                        Second, I moved to the kids’ side. I found that it was not matching the business objectives. A bad quality pictures, no vivid colors, no micro interactions... The first question that came to me is: how they expect the kids to enjoy this experience.
                </p>
                <h2><br>Competitive analysis</h2>

                                It’s important to look into the other players on the market. Thus, I started with the local market then went global. I did not find direct competitors, however, some products like Epic, Wanderful, and Hoopla aim the same audience. Therefore, I analyzed each of them to see which content and functionalities they offer.

                <p>
                        For me, doing this phase right is the first step for a successful project. So, first of all, I organized a meeting with stakeholders to determine the research questions. For each one, I chose a research method to answer it. Once I finished, I defined recruitment criteria and started recruiting participants. A part of them were already our users, but I had to go to specific events to find others. Finally, I was able to start the research after getting their informed consent. Then I started analysis.

                <p>
                        I started grouping the collected information to summarize/share what I learned in the interviews and validate the hypothesis

                <p>
                        Next, I did some empathy maps. You find below one about our persona Khaled who wants his kids to start reading books, so they get used to it.

                <h2><br>Journey maps </h2>
                <p>
                        Now we have empathy for the users It is necessary to search what are their pain points with the existing app so I created few empathy maps with different lenses:
                       <br>
                        •&emsp;Finding Quizzito family <br>
                        •&emsp;The first app use (existing onboarding for both parents and kids’ side) <br>
                        •&emsp;Payment process  <br>
                        
                        Elaborating journey maps enabled me to see precisely what I need to change in the onboarding, the payment process, and other areas. It also helped us as a team to have a unified vision.
                        Note: Before the changes, some parents were not adding any gift for their kids. This was the major issue for their user drop. Now, the parent adds at least 3 gifts just after adding their first kid. For the purchase, the conversion rate raised from 1% to 4% just by ameliorating the payment process.              
                </p>
                <h1><br>Ideation</h1>
                <h2><br>Main functionalities <span style="color:#868686">(simplified)</span></h2>
                <p>
                        The next step in the process was to write and priorities functional specs you find following a simplified version. <br>
                        <br>
                        the parent will be able to : <br>

                        Once the functional specs got approved, I started making the user flows. I choose to keep them simple so we can go faster and do as much iterations as we need. Here an example for the parent onboarding (click for full view):

                                After getting a solid base from research, I was able to start prototyping having my users in mind so here are some chosen screens.
                                <br>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-0 col-lg-2"></div>
               </div>
               <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-12">
                        <img src="/Media/Wireframes_preview.svg" width=100% alt="Wireframes preview">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br><br><br><br>
                <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-sm-0 col-lg-2"></div>
                        <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-8">
                            <img src="/Media/selected_wireframes.svg" width=100% alt="Selected wireframes">
                            <p>
                                    <br> After doing many sessions revising those prototypes I was ready to move to the last step 
                            </p>
                            <h1><br>Prototypes</h1>
                            <p>
                                   <br> Following Quizzito strategy I elaborated a graphic charter so it can be a reference for all the team. Next, I started implementing the screens
                            <br>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-0 col-lg-2"></div>
                   </div>
                   <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-sm-12">
                            <img src="/Media/Day1_p.gif" width=100% alt="Quizzito family screens">
