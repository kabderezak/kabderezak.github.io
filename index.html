                <h1><br>Brief</h1>    
                <p>
                        Quizzito family was designed for Eurl Kitabquiz an Algerian enterprise 
                        interested in kids’ education. They asked me to redesign both their 
                        mobile app user experience and user interface. We did it to add 
                        some functionalities and solve some usability problems. <br>
                        
                        Kid’s, in general, don’t enjoy reading and parents don’t find enough 
                        time to follow with them although they know the importance of such 
                        a thing. <br>
                        
                        This app encourages kids to read more books by enabling them to 
                        win points for each played quiz (quizzes are about books). After 
                        collecting enough points, the kid can use them to buy gifts. The 
                        parents suggest both books and gifts. <br>
                        
                        My challenge was to merge the two existing applications and design 
                        a new experience for two different users while keeping the same 
                        identity.
                        
                </p>
                <h1><br>Research</h1> 
                <h2><br>Stakeholders interviews</h2> 
                <p>
                        At our first interview I prepared a few precise questions to know more about the strategy and business objectives. I found that we can resume the concept in three words: Read, Play, Win.
                        <br>
                        Qui>zzito Family push the kids to read the maximum number of books. The parents choose those books from the app library where they can search and filter using many criteria. Furthermore, it suggests to them suitable books using artificial intelligence. Second, it offers what kids like the most, playing and having fun. It aims to give them an enjoyable experience through tailored quizzes screens. Finally, if they understood the books, they will win points which enables them to buy the suggested gifts.
                        <br>
                        Additionally, to the parents, Quizzito Family has a reading competitions section in order to grow their DAU.

                <h2><br>Existing product audit</h2>
                <p>
                        First, I started with the parents' side. My first impression was that it looks very standard with poor material UI. Once started using it I noticed a bad information architecture and design. But the critical issue was the misleading storyboarding (It was not clear for the parent how and when to add gifts). When I discussed this with stakeholders, they admitted that they had a significant user drop because of this issue.
                        <br>
                        Second, I moved to the kids’ side. I found that it was not matching the business objectives. A bad quality pictures, no vivid colors, no micro interactions... The first question that came to me is: how they expect the kids to enjoy this experience.
                </p>
                <h2><br>Competitive analysis</h2>

                                It’s important to look into the other players on the market. Thus, I started with the local market then went global. I did not find direct competitors, however, some products like Epic, Wanderful, and Hoopla aim the same audience. Therefore, I analyzed each of them to see which content and functionalities they offer.
